### About me
Hello, my name is John Doe. I'm a dedicated creative, a problem solver, and a passionate learner. I've been in the tech industry for about 10 years, primarily working as a Software Developer. I love exploring new technologies and often amazed by the progress we as a human species have made in the past few years.

I have rich experience in Java, Python, and JavaScript. Recently, I've started focusing on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In my free time, I love to hike and explore nature. I also have a passion for photography and enjoy capturing moments of life.
