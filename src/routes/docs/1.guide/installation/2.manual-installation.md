**Routify can be added to any project, but we do recommend trying to the Vite powered starter repo first.**


#### 1. Install
We're using `npm`, but you can use your favorite package manager.
```
npm install @roxi/routify@next
```

#### 2a. Using Vite
If you're using Vite, you can add Routify by updating your Vite config:
```javascript
import routify from '@roxi/routify/vite-plugin'
export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        routify({/* config */})

```

#### 2b. Without Vite

If you're not using Vite, you can Run Routify by adding the following scripts to your package.json:
```json
"watch": "routify -w",
"build": "routify"
```
Running the watch command will let Routify watch your file structure for routes (`src/routes` by default) and rebuild routes as it changes.

#### 3. Integrate Routify
Finally, to add Routify to your app, open a Svelte file (eg. `App.svelte`) and add the following.
```html
<script context="module">
    import { Router, createRouter } from '@roxi/routify'
    import routes from '../.routify/routes.default.js'

    export const router = createRouter({ routes })
</script>

<Router {router} />

```
